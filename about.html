                            <text id="abouttext">Hi! I'm Anu, and thank you for visiting my store. Since you're here, let me tell you a little bit about myself and my knitting journey.

                                <br><br> Born and brought up in India, I picked up knitting in my teenage years. Not only was I inspired by my mother, but I had to knit in school as well (which I obviously enjoyed). Since then, I would knit shawls, scarves, and sweaters for myself and my family members, carrying forward what I learnt throughout the years. 
                                
                                <br><br> For the past 8 years, I have lived in Singapore. And it was here that my passion for knitting grew. Interested in trying something new, I started knitting hats for charity. After organising multiple meetups, events, and knitting for well over a year, I realized that I wanted explore new horizons.

                        <div id="aboutboxrow3"> 
                            <text id="abouttext">Wanting to knit something more complex, I joined my first test knit. And frankly, I loved it. Test knitting allows me to try out new patterns and designs while making a real impact to the knitting community. I mostly test knit shawls, of which you can see many pictures on my Instagram. If you'd like me to test knit something for you, feel free to contact me. 
                                
                                <br><br> At the current moment, I am still test knitting frequently. However, I have too many shawls to possibly use myself, so I've decided to start selling a few on my store here. If you're looking for something to complement your outfits or want to give someone a thoughtful gift, these shawls can really be wonderful. 
                                
                                <br><br> Once again, thanks for visiting my site, and I hope you have a great day. Happy shopping! <br><br>
